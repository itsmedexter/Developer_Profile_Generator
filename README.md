# Node JS Profile generator

Here is a GitHub profile generator made in javascript, Node Js. When run in the command line, user is prompt to enter GitHub username. When entered, axios is uses GitHub API to access username information. When information is returned, a HTML file is created with information and then a converted PDF.

## Always Under Construction 

 1. It was difficult to do, but with help from my tutor, I got an understanding of whats going on with the code. He told me first to see I can just get a console log of username from github. From there, I saw the API information I needed to place in the html. Then slowly it was put together.
